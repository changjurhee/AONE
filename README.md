# Project Deliverables
- There are three milestones required for this project (each of which will be graded independently):
  - **Requirements, plan and risks**: For the first milestone the team will turn in the prioritized architectural drivers, any draft design decisions they are considering, the technical risks identified, and the experimentation plans (or any results already achieved).
  - **Experimentation results, design, plan for construction**: The team will turn in the results of experiments conducted, a design description with different architecture views, and the plan for construction.
  - **Demo and lessons learned**: For the final milestone, the team will demo the completed system, and present the lessons learned.
